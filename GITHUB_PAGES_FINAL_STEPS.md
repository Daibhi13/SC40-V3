### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 min)

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click "+" icon** (top right) → "New repository"
3. **Fill in**:
   - Repository name: `sc40-legal`
   - Description: "Legal documents for Sprint Coach 40 iOS app"
   - **Public** ✅ (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - Don't initialize with README
4. **Click "Create repository"**

---

### Step 2: Push Your Code (3 min)

After creating the repo, GitHub shows you commands. Run these:

```bash
cd /Users/davidoconnell/Projects/SC40-V3

# Add your GitHub repo (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add legal https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sc40-legal.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u legal main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages (2 min)

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub
2. **Click "Settings"** (top menu)
3. **Click "Pages"** (left sidebar)
4. **Under "Source"**:
   - Branch: Select `main`
   - Folder: Select `/docs`
5. **Click "Save"**
