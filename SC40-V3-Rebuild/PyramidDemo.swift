 ## How to Implement Your 10,20,30,40,50 Pyramid in SC40-V3:
 
 ### Method 1: Custom Session Creation
 You can create a custom TrainingSession exactly like the examples above.
 
 ### Method 2: Adding to Session Library
 Add your pyramid to the SessionLibrary.swift file:
 
 ```swift
 SprintSessionTemplate(
     id: 999, 
     name: "Custom 10-20-30-40-50 Pyramid", 
     distance: 50,  // Peak distance
     reps: 5,       // Total pyramid reps
     rest: 120,     // Rest between each distance
     focus: "Progressive Distance Build", 
     level: "Intermediate", 
     sessionType: LibrarySessionType.sprint
 )
 ```
 
 ### Method 3: Watch App Integration
 The WorkoutWatchViewModel will automatically:
 
 1. **Receive distance array**: [440, 0, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 400]
 2. **Display current distance**: Shows "10 yd", "20 yd", "30 yd", "40 yd", "50 yd" during pyramid
 3. **GPS tracking**: Converts to meters (10yd = 9.14m, 20yd = 18.29m, etc.)
 4. **Rest management**: Automatic rest periods between each distance
 5. **Progress tracking**: Shows "Rep 13 of 18" during pyramid section
 
 ### Watch Display Example:
 - Rep 13: "10 yd" ‚Üí GPS tracks 9.14 meters
 - Rep 14: "20 yd" ‚Üí GPS tracks 18.29 meters  
 - Rep 15: "30 yd" ‚Üí GPS tracks 27.43 meters
 - Rep 16: "40 yd" ‚Üí GPS tracks 36.58 meters
 - Rep 17: "50 yd" ‚Üí GPS tracks 45.72 meters
 
 The system handles each distance individually with precise GPS tracking and automatic rest periods.
