# App Icon Conversion Guide - SC40yd by Accelerate

## Current Branding vs App Icon Requirements

### Your Current Logo
- **Text**: "SC40yd" + "by Accelerate"
- **Style**: Typography-focused
- **Use**: Perfect for marketing, website, social media
- **Issue**: Too text-heavy for small app icon sizes

### iOS App Icon Requirements
- **Size Range**: 20×20 to 1024×1024 pixels
- **Readability**: Must be clear at 20×20 (smallest size)
- **Best Practice**: Simple, bold graphics over text
- **Apple Guideline**: Avoid small text (unreadable at small sizes)
