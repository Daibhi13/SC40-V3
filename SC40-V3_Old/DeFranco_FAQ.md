## Bench Press Test Warm-up Example
- 135 x 5
- 185 x 3
- 225 x 1
- 275 x 1 (if max bench is 315–350)
- 315 x 1 (if max bench is 355+)
- 225 x max reps

---

## Weekend Recovery Recommendations
- Massage, foam rolling, ice baths, contrast baths/showers, swimming, static stretching
- Light cardio for overweight athletes (elliptical, bike, uphill treadmill, light sled drag)
- Avoid soreness or interfering with recovery

---

## Why Fewer Full-Speed 40s?
- Focus on correcting the cause of slow 40s (mechanics, acceleration, top-end speed)
- Break down the 40 into parts for targeted improvement
- Reduces injury risk and overtraining

---

## Tempo 40s Explained
- Run 40s at ~85% effort (e.g., 5.2s for a 4.51 athlete)
- Drive out of stance, hit 10-yard mark at full speed, then maintain momentum
- Focus on relaxed top speed mechanics
- Used for conditioning and technique without frying the nervous system

---

## Training Frequency
- One main session per day (not 2-3x/day)
- Designed for real athletes with limited time/resources

---

## Event-Specific Warm-ups
- 40-yard dash: rehearse stance, 2-3 x 10-yard sprints, 1 tempo 40
- 20-yard shuttle: 2-3 x 5-yard side runs
- Vertical jump: static stretch hip flexors, pogo/squat jumps
- Bench press: time warm-up sets to finish 2-3 min before test

---

## Combine Week Recovery
- Take 3 days off before Combine
- Light running/vanity lifting (no legs/bench) if needed
- Stay positive, focus on strengths in final week

---

## Screening & Adjustments
- Evaluate athletes during first week of training (not separate testing days)
- Key drills: dynamic warm-up, vertical jump, box squat, bench press, 40-yard dash
- Adjust program based on observed strengths/weaknesses

---

## Mental Preparation
- Cover every aspect of the Combine (tests, drills, shoes, food, scenarios)
- Repetition builds confidence; keep feedback positive in final week

---

## Footwear Recommendations
- Nike Zoom Waffle Racers (track shoe, no spikes) for 40, jumps
- Nike Vapor Football Cleats for FieldTurf
- Bring both shoes and regular cleats; test early in training
