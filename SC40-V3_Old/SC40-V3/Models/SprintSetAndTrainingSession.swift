// MARK: - SC40 Example Session (Algorithm Friendly)

/// This template demonstrates:
/// - Complete workout flow integration
/// - GPS phase identification (via distance > 0)
/// - Algorithm-friendly structure for scaling and adaptation
/// - Proper rest interval management
/// - Mixed intensity training within a single session
