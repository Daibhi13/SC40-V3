## Date: September 30, 2025
## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive session library browser that provides access to all 240 training sessions from the 12-week SC40 program directly within Xcode for development and testing purposes.

## Changes Made

### 1. **New File: SessionLibraryBrowserView.swift**

Created a full-featured session browser with:

- **Search Functionality**: Text-based search across session types, focus areas, and notes
- **Week Filtering**: Quick filter chips for all 12 weeks plus "All Weeks" option
- **Session Count Display**: Real-time count of filtered sessions
- **Detailed Session Cards**: Each card shows:
  - Week and day number
  - Session type with appropriate icon
  - Focus area
  - Sprint sets with reps, distance, and intensity
  - Accessory work
  - Coach notes
- **Tap to View Details**: Opens the existing `DayDetailView` for full session information

### 2. **Updated: AdaptiveWorkoutHub.swift**

Modified to support the session library browser:

- Added `@EnvironmentObject var userProfileVM: UserProfileViewModel` to:
  - `AdaptiveWorkoutHub`
  - `WorkoutLauncherView`
  - `PhoneLaunchView`
  - `SmartLaunchView`
  - `PhoneWorkoutInterface`
- Added `@State private var showSessionLibrary = false` to `PhoneWorkoutInterface`
- Updated "Browse All Sessions" button to trigger the sheet:
  ```swift
  Button("Browse All Sessions") {
      showSessionLibrary = true
      print("ðŸ“š Opening session library browser...")
  }
  ```
- Added sheet presentation:
  ```swift
  .sheet(isPresented: $showSessionLibrary) {
      SessionLibraryBrowserView()
          .environmentObject(userProfileVM)
  }
  ```
- Passed environment objects through the view hierarchy

### 3. **Updated: TrainingView.swift**

Modified to pass `UserProfileViewModel` to workout hub:

- Added `@EnvironmentObject var userProfileVM: UserProfileViewModel` to `StartSessionButton`
- Updated NavigationLink to pass environment object:
  ```swift
  NavigationLink(destination: AdaptiveWorkoutHub().environmentObject(userProfileVM))
  ```
- Passed environment object to `StartSessionButton` in main dashboard

## Technical Details

### Data Source

- Sessions retrieved via `userProfileVM.getAllSessionsOrdered()`
- Returns all 240 sessions from the 12-week program
- Sessions are sorted by week and day

### Environment Object Propagation

The `UserProfileViewModel` is passed through the view hierarchy:
```
TrainingView
  â””â”€> StartSessionButton
      â””â”€> AdaptiveWorkoutHub
          â””â”€> WorkoutLauncherView
              â”œâ”€> PhoneLaunchView
              â”‚   â””â”€> PhoneWorkoutInterface
              â”‚       â””â”€> SessionLibraryBrowserView
              â””â”€> SmartLaunchView
                  â””â”€> PhoneWorkoutInterface
                      â””â”€> SessionLibraryBrowserView
```

### State Management

- `@State private var showSessionLibrary: Bool` controls sheet presentation
- `@State private var selectedSession: TrainingSession?` tracks tapped session
- `@State private var searchText: String` for search filtering
- `@State private var selectedWeek: Int?` for week filtering
