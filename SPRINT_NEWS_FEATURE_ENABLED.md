## API Key Setup (Optional)

### For Real Live News

To get actual live news instead of mock data:

1. Visit [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/)
2. Sign up for a free API key
3. Open `NewsViewModel.swift`
4. Replace the demo key on line 30:
   ```swift
   private let apiKey = "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

**Free tier includes:**
- 100 requests per day
